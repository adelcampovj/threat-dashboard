## Installation

This is a Python based CLI application - no installation required. Just follow the steps below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/threat-dashboard.git
cd threat-dashboard
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate        # On Windows: .\env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, rename `config_sample.json` to `config.json`, and paste your own API keys like this:

```json
{
  "abuseipdb": "YOUR_ABUSEIPDB_KEY",
  "virustotal": "YOUR_VIRUSTOTAL_KEY",
  "alienvault": "YOUR_ALIENVAULT_KEY"
}
```

## Usage

Run the program using:

```bash
python src/dashboard.py
```

Follow the prompts:

1. Choose the scan type (IP, Hash, Domain)
2. Enter the input value when asked
3. Review results and alerts in the terminal
4. Exit to auto-save results

Output files:
- `data/threat_data.csv` – stores all scanned entries
- `logs/threat_dashboard.log` – records API and system activity

💡 If you see import warnings in VS Code, make sure your virtual environment is active and the Python interpreter is selected correctly.
